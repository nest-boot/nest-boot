# Example client

TanStack Start client for the Nest Boot full-stack example. It uses Apollo
Client and GraphQL for browser authentication and application APIs, including
social and generic OAuth authorization flows. Better Auth remains an internal
server implementation detail. The UI uses shadcn, internationalization, and
Playwright end-to-end tests.

Email/password flows use GraphQL end to end. The example includes persistent
and browser-session sign-in, enumeration-safe password recovery, reset-token
handling, registration verification with resend and callback states, and
authenticated password changes under `/user/security`. The security page also
lists active sessions and can revoke one or every other session. The personal
profile page supports a two-stage email change that confirms the current
address before verifying the new address.

## Run locally

Start the example server first, then run the client:

```bash
cp examples/server/.env.example examples/server/.env
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-server dev
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client dev
```

The client listens on `http://localhost:3000` and proxies `/api` requests to
`http://localhost:4000`.

## Generated GraphQL types

The checked-in GraphQL client types are generated from
`examples/server/schema.gql`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client codegen
```

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client build
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client lint
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client test
pnpm --filter @nest-boot/example-client test:e2e
```
